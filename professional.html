        The Energy Efficient Circuits and Systems group is a research group at Northeastern focused on ultra-low-power devices and energy harvesting. By developing low power devices, EECS enables IoT devices to be deployed in a wider range of applications. The lab also has projects including analog computing, neural circuits, and high reliability design. I started work with EECS my first year at Northeastern, and I’ve had the opportunity to work extensively on the testing processes in the lab. By applying SCPI commands from both MATLAB and Python, I’ve been able to automate many of the testing processes, reducing time spent gathering data and allowing designs to progress at a faster rate. I’ve recently started circuit design work for EECS, and I’m excited to continue down this path in the future. Also, I worked during the summer on a educational project for the lab which can be seen under the projects tab.

    <p>Generate is a student-led product development studio that works with outside clients to design, develop, and prototype products. As a Hardware Engineer, I work on all aspects of the project relating to Electrical and Computer Engineering. We typically start from scratch, meaning we have to prototype a product based on design requirements and goals. We must specify parts depending on restraints such as power optimization, torque minimums, communication range, and more. Prototyping a project typically includes the design of embedded systems using microcontrollers such as STM-32 and Arduino Boards, circuit and PCB design, and soldering. As a member of the Generate team, I have to meet twice weekly to discuss design decisions and progress as well as meet with clients to share our ideas. At our workshops, I have to opportunity to practice skills like soldering and learn about various topics applicable to our projects such as Git and communication protocols among others. Generate takes on a wide variety of clients, and I’ve had the opportunity to work with two different projects so far, more details on those projects can be found on my projects page.
