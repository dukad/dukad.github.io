            Hey! I’m Kaden Du— welcome to my personal website. This site is meant to give both a professional summary, but also to give a place for me to put content about my personal life. Check out ‘professional’ tab to view my work experience, ‘projects’ to see what I’ve been working on, and ‘personal’ to learn more about what I do outside of work and school.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently a second-year majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Ethics at Northeastern University. At school, I’ve joined the Taekwondo Team, the Radio Station, and Generate Product Development among other clubs, and I’ve loved being a part of these communities. I grew up primarily in Boulder, Colorado, but also lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Sunnyvale, California, for parts of my childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently looking for my first Co-op opportunity, and I’ll be open to work July through December 2023. I’m primarily interested in analog and mixed signal design, but I hope to learn about a wider range of subjects along the way.
        </p>
